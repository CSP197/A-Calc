## Features
This application currently supports the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations over numbers from zero to nine. (More coming soon!)

### For the mathematically inclined :)
```y = α(x) st. x ∈ [0,9] and α ∈ [+, -, ×, ÷]```

#### Disclaimer
The code is run solely in your browser, so any incomplete queries will definitely freeze your client. 

I `promise` I'll fix this soon lol
