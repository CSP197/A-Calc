# αCalc

Built with `Typescript`, using `React.js` with `Vite`, `Tailwind CSS` with `Headless UI` & hosted on `Github Pages`!

###### You can only see the minified and compressed `HTML` code in the `gh-pages` branch. The source code is currently private because reasons.

## Features
This application currently supports the following mathematical operations:
1. addition
2. subtraction
3. multiplication
4. division
5. modulus

The syntax for the input queries supports fuzzy search and must be expressed in the English language. 

For Example: `too => two => 2, tree => three => 3 ...`

### For the mathematically inclined :)
```
    y = α(x) 
    st. 
    x is a string over the English alphabet represented by Σ, 
        defined by the set, {{A,Z},{a,z}} 
    α ∈ [+, -, ×, ÷, %] and 
    y ∈ ℝ
 
 ```

#### Disclaimer
The code runs solely in your browser, so any queries with incomplete syntax will definitely freeze your client. 😬
